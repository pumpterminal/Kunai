# Kunai
Kunai is a fast modular searcher written in Rust. It has functions for buying, selling, creating coins in pumpfun, sniping in radyum and copy trading

A terminal-based sniping bot is a command-line tool designed to automate the rapid purchase (sniping) of newly listed tokens on blockchain networks like Solana or Ethereum. These bots monitor decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for new token listings and execute buy orders within milliseconds of a token's launch, aiming to capitalize on early investment opportunities.

## Key Features:

### Automated Monitoring: The bot continuously scans the blockchain for new token listings or liquidity pools, ensuring immediate detection of potential investment opportunities.

### Rapid Transaction Execution: Upon identifying a new listing, the bot swiftly executes buy orders, often within the same block as the token's launch, to secure tokens at the lowest possible price.

### Configurable Parameters: Users can customize settings such as the amount to invest per token, acceptable slippage rates, gas fees, and specific tokens or contracts to target or avoid.

### Risk Management Tools:

### Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Orders: Automatically sell tokens when they reach predefined price thresholds to secure profits or minimize losses.
### Rug Pull Protection: Implement checks to detect potential scams, such as analyzing liquidity pool characteristics, token ownership distribution, and contract code for malicious functions.
### Multi-Wallet Support: Some bots allow the use of multiple wallets simultaneously, enabling diversified investment strategies and circumventing per-wallet purchase limits.

### Integration with Private Nodes: Connecting to private or high-performance nodes can enhance transaction speed and reliability, reducing the risk of failed transactions due to network congestion.
